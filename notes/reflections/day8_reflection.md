## ‚úçÔ∏è Reflection Prompts

**1. What was the most challenging part of today‚Äôs work?**  
I think the most challenging part of today was understanding the scheduler job and using callback functions.

**2. What was the most satisfying moment?**  
The most satisfying part was seeing it come together on Streamlit.

**3. What concept or technique do you now feel more confident in?**  
I feel more confident using callbacks in Python.

**4. What surprised you or tripped you up?**  
The demo script surprised me a bit. I didn't know where to put the new code. But it was resolved quickly and easily.

**5. Anything you'd like to revisit, improve, or document later?**  
Not that I can think of. Today was pretty complete in my mind.

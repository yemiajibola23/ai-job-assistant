# ðŸ“˜ Day 2 Reflection â€“ Resume Matching

**Date:** May 31, 2025

---

### 1. What was the most challenging part of todayâ€™s work?

The most challenging part of today's work was wrapping my head around calculating the cosine similarity of the matches from the resume to the job descriptions. Ultimately, it makes sense tho.

### 2. What was the most satisfying or enjoyable part?

The most satisfying part will always be seeing the code do what you want it to. So seeing the scores calculated and the correct job being recommended was nice. I also enjoy what I'm learning.

### 3. What concept or technique do you feel you understand better now?

I think I understand a little bit more about how statistical models work.

### 4. Was anything surprising or unexpected during implementation or testing?

Having the runtime error because the test file didn't recognize the backend was a little surprising.

### 5. Is there anything you'd like to revisit or go deeper on later?

I still struggle a little bit with understanding encoding but I think that's ok.
